                <h3><u>Context</u></h3>
                <p>
                    In May of 2021, I decided to make a change. I had spent the last few months mostly sedentary,
                    blaming my lack of physical activity on Doug Ford locking down the gyms. The depressing Waterloo
                    winter combined with a stressful time at my internship had turned me into a literal potato. Over the
                    course of 4 months, I had gained over 20 pounds of excess weight and felt dreadful – activities that
                    I had previously enjoyed like running or basketball were becoming increasingly difficult and less
                    fun.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This stretch of time was marred with body dysmorphia, self-hate, and fear. In high school, playing
                    sports year-round had always kept me fit and well-conditioned, constantly boosting my energy and
                    confidence. I detested the way I “let myself go” and began becoming incessantly angry at myself,
                    hoping I’d bully myself into doing better. Unsurprisingly, this toxic mindset proved
                    to be ridiculously unproductive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I didn’t really have a specific turning point, but I somehow started dragging myself out of the
                    house for short jogs and exercises – I’d run from my apartment to the local park and do some push
                    ups against the benches. Gradually, this became part of my daily routine. Instead of firing up
                    league of legends right after work, I’d get a solid 45 minutes of exercise in. After several weeks
                    of this, the gyms reopened, and I started integrating trips to the University gym with my daily work
                    schedule. In the year that’s passed since then, these workouts have grown into a quintessential part
                    of my
                    life. I’m now lifting 5-6 days a week and doing some form of physical activity every single day.
                    Always prioritizing my health has been an interesting journey, and I’m excited to share some lessons
                    from along the way.

                        <u>Have clear goals</u>
                        <p>
                            I started exercising just for the sake of exercising. Don’t get me wrong, this is better
                            than nothing, but it’s far from a solid approach. Take some time to think about what you
                            want
                            to accomplish. Whether it’s losing excess fat, developing athletic performance, or getting
                            fit enough to hike Half Dome during your next Cali internship, having concrete goals is
                            essential. What does your ideal body look and feel like? For me personally, I wanted to
                            develop a more muscular & aesthetic physique but also build strength and athleticism at the
                            same time. I recommend starting with some benchmarking – observe your height, weight, and
                            physique, but also take notes on how your body feels after some basic physical movements (a
                            short jog, some push ups, or other exercises). This benchmark will serve as your starting
                            point – seeing your progress from where you started is a huge motivator that’ll keep you
                            going!

                        <u>Do your research</u>
                        <p>
                            Now that your goals are established, literally take 10 minutes to get a baseline
                            understanding of how to achieve them. Speak to a gym attendant (they’re almost always
                            friendly and knowledgeable), a friend (I volunteer as tribute :) ), or do a cursory google
                            search for some popular sources of knowledge. These are some of my favorites:

                            You don’t need to spend long here. Like I said, 10 minutes of scrolling through “first day
                            at the gym” on TikTok or YouTube will work wonders.

                        <p>
                            I’m surprised that I didn’t quickly lose interest initially without a gym buddy. Let’s be
                            real, the actual concept of working out is lame. You’re literally picking up heavy objects
                            only to put them back down again. Being able to have someone to hold you accountable and
                            work towards your goals with is severely underrated. I’m endlessly grateful for my meathead
                            roommates and classmates who make the gym a fun social environment too. I recommend making a
                            schedule with these buddies – whether it’s once, twice, or six days a week, having a
                            consistent slot will keep you coming back.
                        </p>

                        <u>Nutrition is king</u>
                        <p>
                            This point should honestly be number 1 but it wouldn’t make sense without context. The
                            biggest reason why people don’t progress in fitness is nutrition. Managing your weight is
                            ultimately a simple question: how does the calories you’re consuming compare to the calories
                            you’re burning? Everyone has a “maintenance caloric intake” – the amount they eat on a
                            regular day that keeps their body composition the same. I would start by tracking what you
                            eat in a regular week on an app like MyFitnessPal. Don’t try to fudge any numbers or modify
                            your diet – be completely honest with yourself. From there, add or subtract a few hundred a
                            day and you’re well on your way. I personally love food and shudder at the idea of not being able to
                            eat yummy things while trying to achieve my fitness goals. Although it’s true that many of
                            our favorite student foods (Ramen, Pizza, Shawarma, etc.) are unhealthy for various reasons,
                            at the end of the day it’s all about portion control. During my final week of cutting weight
                            this semester, I literally ate Lazeez three times in 8 meals. Replacing that box of carbs and sauce
                            with sweet potatoes and chicken breast would be far better for you, but I can anecdotally
                            assure you that it’s more than possible to achieve your goals like this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After figuring out your caloric intake, you can start considering your macronutrient
                            consumption to optimize your diet. The 3 key “macros” are carbohydrates, fat, and protein.
                            MyFitnessPal (or similar applications) helps you establish targets for each of these core
                            nutrients and meeting them consistently will speed up your progress.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’ve personally struggled with staying disciplined in hitting these targets every single
                            day. <u>That's okay.</u> Indulging in a cheat meal or two (or many) may be slowing you down,
                            but the compounded outcome all your positive actions will ultimately pull through. Don’t
                            beat yourself up over little losses, keep your chin up and let your habits carry you!

                        <p>
                            You can easily have a full-body workout and strength-building routine without
                            any weights and equipment. The pandemic has taught us to be resourceful in many ways,
                            especially in home workout setups. I started doing push-ups, squats, and pull-ups in between
                            zoom meetings and lectures, which proved to be a great strategy to avoid screen fatigue. If
                            you squeeze in 20 push-ups between each lecture, you can easily hit 100 a day – the amount
                            prescribed to Marine Corps recruits. Just like nutrition, tiny habits like this go a long
                            way.

                        <u>Don’t forget your warmups, cardio, and mobility</u>
                        <p>
                            Injuries suck. Not only do they prevent you from exercising, but they could also severely
                            mess up your quality of life down the road, especially if you’re already a grown adult.
                            Stretching properly and warming your heart rate up are some of the most ignored habits.
                            Taking 5 minutes of your day to just making sure your joints are moving correctly can save
                            you a lot of pain in the future. I personally force myself to warm up for at least 2 full
                            songs on my playlist before I move to a working weight. In addition, dedicating time after a
                            workout to do mobility stretches and different recovery techniques is also a game changer.
                            Icing/massaging sore muscles, getting full range of motion in your joints, or even just
                            walking to cool down can boost your performance for your next workout.

                        <u>Consistency is more important than optimization</u>
                        <p>
                            A big mistake is worrying about whether each exercise or workout is “perfectly optimal”. I
                            would sometimes skip exercises because someone would say it wasn’t optimal or even skip
                            workouts because I wouldn’t have enough time to get through all my sets. My takeaway here is
                            to always prioritize consistency over optimization. A suboptimal workout is better than no
                            workout at all! I recommend looking to optimize individual movements as you get comfortable
                            with a program or workout schedule. Having to worry about optimization when you’re still
                            trying to build the discipline and confidence to keep coming back to the gym is just
                            overkill.

                            There are only 3 mainstream fitness supplements that are absolutely proven to work.
                        </p>

                            <li>
                                Protein
                                <p>
                                    As stated above, one of the 3 essential macronutrients. Protein helps with muscle
                                    growth and tissue repair, hormone/enzyme generation, and nutritional needs.
                                    Something like Whey Protein powder can really help with hitting your caloric and
                                    macronutrient goals. When shopping for these supplements, I simply look for a cheap
                                    source of high-quality whey that has interesting flavors to keep things fresh. I’ve
                                    personally tried Revolution Nutrition and MyProtein, with both satisfying my needs
                                    quite well.

                                Creatine
                                <p>
                                    The other muscle-building supplement is Creatine. It’s commonly found in red meat
                                    and seafood but is usually sold in a synthetic version (Creatine Monohydrate). The
                                    compound is proven to boost strength and muscle recovery speed, as it enables
                                    skeletal muscle fibres to absorb more water and boost ATP production. I would take
                                    5g of creatine a day whenever I exercised, making sure to drink extra water to make
                                    up for the increased water absorption in my muscles.

                                Caffeine
                                <p>
                                    Pre-workout supplements always include caffeine, the godly stimulant us university
                                    students consume at an ungodly rate. As a stimulant, caffeine keeps you alert and
                                    sharp, which helps in a workout. However, I would advise against regularly using
                                    pre-workout, as I’ve found it quite easy to slip into a caffeine addiction. I’ve
                                    previously tried Batch27 and Revolution Nutrition’s Bull Dose Rush, using them
                                    whenever I was feeling tired or preparing for a big workout.

                        <p>
                            That’s it. Protein, Creatine, and Caffeine are the only supplements you should really
                            consider. Don’t bother wasting money on amino acids, Glutamine, Turkesterone, or whatever
                            other shiny expensive bottle is pitched to you on Instagram. In an ideal world, everyone
                            would be able to achieve their fitness goals without supplements, but the 3 listed above
                            make overcoming genetic/lifestyle barriers just a tiny bit easier.

                <h3><u>Closing Thoughts</u></h3>
                <p>
                    Your physical health is closely tied with your mental well-being. I’ve become a strong believer in
                    the idea that everyone needs an outlet for self-expression – examples include visual art, writing,
                    music, dance, or in my case, independent sport. I find this particularly interesting because of how
                    personal independent sports are. People often enjoy team sports like Frisbee or Basketball because
                    of social aspects like collaboration or teamwork, but those are largely missing in an independent
                    sport like weightlifting.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In each individual lifting session, your only competitor is really yourself. Can you beat yourself?
                    Can you overcome your previous weaknesses? This feeling is truly cathartic and really helped clear
                    my headspace. Sometimes, you’ll have a “perfect” lift – a moment where you’re completely in tune
                    with your body and mind, dedicating every single bit of your energy to a single movement. Even
                    though it lasts less than a minute, you feel innately human – so perfectly flawed. I think moments
                    like this are what makes fitness a great outlet for self-expression. I’ve developed more
                    mindfulness, patience, and care for my own body. With that, I can confidently that getting my ass to
                    the gym was the best decision I’ve made. Maybe it could be a huge help for you too ;)
